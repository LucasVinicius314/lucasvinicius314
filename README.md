### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I do some stuff.

I'm a fullstack developer, mainly focused on JavaScript, doing back end development with NodeJS and mobile development with React Native.

I love regular expressions, prototypes, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, asynchronous functions, IIFEs and classes.

React Native is what I use most of the time to make apps, but I've also played around with Xamarin and Flutter.
